    <h2>A description of cereal</h2>
    <p>
        Cereal comes in all shapes and sizes.And flavours too.
        Traditionally eaten for breakfast but it more than helps saitate hunger
        during the evening or late night as well
    </p>
    <p>
        Having multiple cereals is also a wise choice
        as you can have sugary cereal to satisfy your sweet tooth
        while having higher fiber content cereal for those days
        where you might have... internal issues.
    </p>
