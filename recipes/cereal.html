    <div>
    <p>
        Cereal comes in all shapes and sizes.And flavours too.
        Traditionally eaten for breakfast but it more than helps saitate hunger
        during the evening or late night as well
    </p>
    <p>
        Having multiple cereals is also a wise choice
        as you can have sugary cereal to satisfy your sweet tooth
        while having higher fiber content cereal for those days
        where you might have... internal issues.
    </p>

        While some may say the following order is optional
        it is in fact quite not so. Beware.
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Grab bowl and pour cereal first</strong></li>
            <li><em>Then</em> pour milk</li>
            <li>Enjoy :)</li>
        </ol>
